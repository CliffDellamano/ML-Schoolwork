# ML-Schoolwork
This is a collection, grouped by homework assignment, of various implementations of ML algorithms and concepts. Examples include KNN, GMM, neural networks/MLPs, SVM, and others.

Each directory cooresponds to a homework assignment, and the .pdf within each directory contains the problems within the assignment. Some problems did not require programming, so they were omitted from the repository.

A rough outline of each assignment is as follows:

HW0: Basic 2D perceptron

HW1: Maximum Likelihood estimation (MLE) on Bernoulli distributions

HW2: Multivariate Gaussian distributions, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

HW3: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms, k-Means Clustering

HW4: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) w/ gradient descent, Neural networks

HW5: Kernel methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
